/**
 * Admission of one backend declaration (B-2, W-1): what the *host* knows about a
 * `BackendSpec`, decided before anything runs.
 *
 * `validateBackendSpec()` (tui-profile) answers "is this shape well formed?".
 * This answers the other half: "can this host honor it?" — a capability name in a
 * vocabulary the host does not implement, a permission name with no grant, an id
 * the host owns. The two are deliberately separate layers: the shape validator
 * lives with the protocol (it must reject the same thing in every host that
 * implements the family), while these verdicts depend on host state.
 *
 * The five-state vocabulary is reused verbatim from the plugin admission
 * (`NegotiationDecision`, `NEGOTIATION_ERROR_CODES`), not invented here:
 * a contribution family speaks the same admission language as every other
 * plugin surface, and `negotiate.ts` stays untouched (it has no backend concept
 * and does not need one).
 *
 * **Scope (W-1).** This decides; it does not wire the family into the registry /
 * descriptor chain. A third-party bundle still cannot reach a picker through it —
 * that is the C stage's entry condition, not a gap in this function.
 *
 * **Published codes.** The contract profile
 * (`tui-profile/registry/contracts/backend-v1alpha1.json`) publishes exactly the
 * codes this file can produce: `BACKEND_ID_RESERVED` and `PERMISSION_NOT_GRANTED`.
 * A code with no producer is a phantom its readers would write error handling for,
 * so a future one waits until the stage that gives it a producer
 * (`scripts/verify-backend-contribution.ts` pins the pair).
