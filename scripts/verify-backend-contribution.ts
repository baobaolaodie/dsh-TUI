/**
 * Backend contribution family gate (B-2, W-1).
 *
 * What it pins, in order:
 *  1. **Dogfood** — every built-in manifest projects onto the public declaration
 *     shape and survives the family's own validator, with no in-tree private key
 *     leaking through, and the projection is pure.
 *  2. **Single source** — the capability vocabulary equals `SessionCapabilities`'
 *     member names (bidirectional, TS AST) and the reserved id set equals the
 *     registry's built-in ids.
 *  3. **Admission** — the verdicts this host can produce, the shape of a
 *     `waiting_authorization` refusal, and the reason codes the contract profile
 *     publishes (each published code needs a producer, so a phantom name fails).
 *  4. **The probe backend** — the resource invariants claude and codex are held to
 *     (never loaded means never imported, never closed; only what was loaded is
 *     closed), the two install-surface shapes, and the declaration covering what
 *     the session actually serves.
 *  5. **Bad declarations** — each one refused, loudly.
 *  6. **Bad baseline** — the load-bearing checkers above go red on an injected
 *     input, which is what makes them checks rather than decoration. Unlike the
 *     boundary gate (whose subject is a file tree, so it copies one), the subject
 *     here is the registry pipeline, so the injection is the mutated input itself.
 *  7. **Scope guard (W-1)** — the family is deliberately NOT wired into the
 *     registry/descriptor chain: `Backend` is absent from the host's supported
 *     contracts, `registryEntries()` still does not read the registry's
 *     `extensions` section, and the contract profile is published without a
 *     registry entry. That is a *pinned boundary*, not an oversight: the C stage's
 *     entry condition is exactly this work, so these assertions are meant to change
 *     then — on purpose, not by drift.
 *
 * Run: node --import tsx/esm scripts/verify-backend-contribution.ts (no build)
