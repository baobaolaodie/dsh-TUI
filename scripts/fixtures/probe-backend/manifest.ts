/**
 * A third-party-looking backend declaration (F-1 fixture, B-2).
 *
 * Real files rather than a string template, so the gate drives the *same* code
 * path a bundle would: `registerBackend({ manifest, load })`, the lazy loader, the
 * pool ledger, the install surface. It sits under `scripts/` on purpose — the
 * build-time index only scans `src/backends/<dir>/manifest.ts`, so this can never
 * be picked up into `GENERATED_BACKENDS` and never reaches a user's picker
 * (D-2/F-1). The price is that `tsc` does not check it, exactly like every other
 * gate script in this repository.
 *
 * Zero vendor imports: it declares what any third-party backend would declare and
 * nothing about which SDK it drives.
